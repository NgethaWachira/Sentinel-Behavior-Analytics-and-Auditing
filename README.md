# Objective
The objective is to guide users in setting up and using Microsoft Sentinel for security monitoring, anomaly detection, auditing, and content search. We explain how to enable UEBA to detect abnormal user behaviors, configure audit logging to track user activities, and perform content searches for compliance and investigation purposes. We also cover the integration of Microsoft Entra ID, setting up diagnostic settings, and querying logs in Azure Log Analytics Workspace to improve security, monitoring, and data analysis.

## Skills Learned
- UEBA Configuration and Usage: Learned how to enable and configure User Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) in Microsoft Sentinel to detect abnormal user behavior and analyze user activity.

- I understood how to set up anomaly-based rules, such as Near Real Time (NRT) rules, to identify unusual activities in the environment using KQL (Kusto Query Language).

- Sentinel Data Integration: Gained knowledge on how to collect and integrate data from SaaS applications, on-premises applications, and Microsoft Entra ID into Microsoft Sentinel.

- Learned how to enable and configure audit logging in Microsoft Sentinel to record user and admin activity, as well as setting permissions to manage audit functions.

- Content Search and eDiscovery: Learned how to perform content searches for compliance, as well as using eDiscovery features for forensic investigations and managing eDiscovery roles.

- I understood how to set up diagnostic settings for Microsoft Entra ID and integrate them with Azure Log Analytics to collect log data.

- Log Querying and Management: I learned how to perform queries on log data within Azure Log Analytics and handle Microsoft Graph Activity Logs.

- Role and Permission Management: I gained experience in managing roles and permissions related to auditing and eDiscovery to ensure proper access control for sensitive activities.
